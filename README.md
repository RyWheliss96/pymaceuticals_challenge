The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results

##My Analysis
- According to the data, Ramicane and Capomulin were the drugs with the most Timepoints which at the very least equates to the most data points but could mean that they were the most successful drugs which caused more timepoints. 
- According to the data, Ramicane and Capomulin were the data with the best average Tumor Volume with their lowest average numbers as well as a clear boxplot with a lower IQR than the rest. Infubinol had one outlier which was lower than the rest and so is worth continuing to investigate just in case but it could be a fluke bringing their data averages down.
- Finally, according to the data, the weight of the mouse strongly correlates to the volume of the tumor. This could be because the tumor is large causing the weight to be bigger, but there is a strong correlation and worth further investigationg.
 

## My Work
    Most of my process was very straight forward. I completed all of the working testing along the way
    All code was generated by myself
